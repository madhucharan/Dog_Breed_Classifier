This is a project  under Udacity deep learning nano Degree program.

## Short Description:

A neural network designed using Pytorch from scratch to classify the breed of the dog in an image 

Transfer Learning approach by using pretrained VGG16 model to classify the dog breed much more clearly and getting a good accuracy with just 2 epochs and can be improvised by traning with more number of epochs
